You will DIE in DARKNESS!
Your BLOOD will feed HER hunger!
You DARE to challenge un child de l'underdark?
Weak - just like la rest of your kind!
I will CARVE OUT YOUR HEART for mon goddess!
Her hand guides mon blade!
Surrender and perhaps I'll grant you un quick death, oui?
Skewer them! Let their screams echo throughout la caverns!
Bleed, wretch! Your agony is un symphony to mon ears!
Nothing but death awaits you down here, fool.
You are nothing but un worm beneath mon heel. Perish!
Squirm, insect!
I want to hear you BEG before l'end!
I'll take mon time breaking you, piece by piece!
Another body for les skallax to feast on! 
Her will is absolute - your life ends here, fool!
Mon dieu!
En garde!
